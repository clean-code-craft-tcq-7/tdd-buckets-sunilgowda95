Input:
    A set of periodic current samples from a charging session, as an array of integers.

Requirement:
    Find continuous range, number of readings in each range and output in CSV format.

TDD approach:
    1.  Test : adding test case 01 : with input [4,5] expected output '4-5,2' : Commit c35f6b0.
            assert get_range([4,5]) == "4-5, 2"
        Action : adding minimum code to pass test case 01 : Commit 257f19a.
            def get_range(current_samples):
        Assumption : sending harcoded string.

    2.  Test : adding test case 02 to fail assumption from test case 01 : Commit 372b9cc.
            assert get_range([4,5,5,6]) == "4-6, 4"
        Action : adding small code to pass test case 02 : Commit 1831918.
            def get_range(current_samples):
            def get_unique_list(input):
        Assumption : assumed entire list is always continuous, extracting first and last value
            to get range. Getting count from unique list.
    
    3.  Test : adding test case 03 to fail assumption from test case : Commit 8ef166a.
            assert get_range([4,5,5,6,9,10]) == "4-6, 4\n9-10 2"
        Action : adding code to pass test case 03 : Commit feaed9f.
            added code and refractored to pass quality checks.
                    
            Requirement Breakdown:
                1. Find continuous ranges.
                    1.1 sort the data.
                    1.2 check for continuous range.
                2. Count reading in each range.
                3. Output in CSV string format.

Data Driven Test :
    Added all possible combinations of data.
    sorted, unsorted, empty, negative & positive integers.

BDD Test:
    Added test cases for all the refractored functions.
